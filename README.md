# Goldman-Sachs-Crack-Leaked-Passsword-Database

## Project Objective
`What type of hashing algorithm was used to protect passwords?`

`What level of protection does the mechanism offer for passwords?`

`What controls could be implemented to make cracking much harder for the hacker in the event of a password database leaking again?`

`What can you tell about the organization’s password policy (e.g. password length, key space, etc.)?`

`What would you change in the password policy to make breaking the passwords harder?` 


## Resources 

Given [Password Dump](https://cdn.theforage.com/vinternships/companyassets/MBA4MnZTNFEoJZGnk/passwd_dump.txt) for task to crack.

Full detail of given task is [here](https://www.theforage.com/modules/NPdeQ43o8P9HJmJzg/G5apo6ujfBcgYTBDn) <br>
I personally prefer [dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/md5-hash) for decode hash keys, this is best decoder which I have used.
